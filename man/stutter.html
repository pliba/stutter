       stutter - a simple lisp interpreter


</PRE>
<H4>SYNOPSIS</H4><PRE>
       <B>stutter</B> <B>-help</B>
         or

<H4>DESCRIPTION</H4><PRE>
       This  is  a  simple lisp interpreter that only understands
       car, cdr, cons, if, set, equal, quote, and lambda, but  is
       still Turing-complete.  It uses stop-and-copy garbage col-
       lection and has an  adjustable  heap  size.   Besides  the
       primitive functions listed above, STUTTER only knows about
       two cells, t and nil.  See the examples  for  how  integer
       arithmetic and more complicated programming constructs can
       be formed with the primitives.


</PRE>
<H4>OPTIONS</H4><PRE>
       <B>-heap</B> <I>integer</I>
              Number of cells in the heap.


</PRE>
<H4>BUGS</H4><PRE>
       If STUTTER can free no cell after a call  to  the  garbage
       collector, it will exit.

       In  the  data directory are the STUTTER examples demo.slp,
       sample.slp and float.slp, which may be helpful.
